/**
 * File: errors.h
 * --------------
 * This file defines an error-reporting class with a set of already
 * implemented static methods for reporting the standard Decaf errors.
 * You should report all errors via this class so that your error
 * messages will have the same wording/spelling as ours and thus
 * diff can easily compare the two. If needed, you can add new
 * methods if you have some fancy error-reporting, but for the most
 * part, you will just use the class as given.

/**
 * General notes on using this class
 * ----------------------------------
 * Each of the methods in thie class matches one of the standard Decaf
 * errors and reports a specific problem such as an unterminated string,
 * type mismatch, declaration conflict, etc. You will call these methods
 * to report problems encountered during the analysis phases. All methods
 * on this class are static, thus you can invoke methods directly via
 * the class name, e.g.
 *
 *    if (missingEnd) { 
 *       ReportError::UntermString(&yylloc, str);
 *    }
 *
 * For some methods, the first argument is the pointer to the location
 * structure that identifies where the problem is (usually this is the
 * location of the offending token). You can pass NULL for the argument
 * if there is no appropriate position to point out. For other methods,
 * location is accessed by messaging the node in error which is passed
 * as an argument. You cannot pass NULL for these arguments.
