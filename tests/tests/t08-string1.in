"A string walks into a bar and orders a beer."
"The bartender looks at him and says, we don't serve strings here."
"The string walks out to the street, and sits on the curb, dejected."
"Then he has an idea: he ties himself into a bow, and loosens up his"
"ends, making them up into nice tassels."
"His confidence restored, he walks back into the bar, sits down, and orders"
"another beer."
"The bartender looks at him suspiciously: he looks a bit like the string"
"that had just walked in. Hey, he says, aren't you a string?"
"Nope, says the string.  I'm a frayed knot."
